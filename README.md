# Metaball

I happened to wonder how metaballs are constructed from a mathematical standpoint. As it turns out, they're a bit of a pain to generate in a vector form or without without aliasing. My solution to aliasing is the most obvious and efficient, naturally; virtual super-resolution.

This project is currently just a wallpaper generator basically. It'll probably be pretty fucking slow, too.
